Dotfiles
========

Personal, stripped-down, bare-bone dotfile collection. This will probably be useless to almost anybody. For a full-featured set of dotfiles, I recommend [https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and [https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles).
